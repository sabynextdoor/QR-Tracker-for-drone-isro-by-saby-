## 🎯 Overview

The **ISRO IROUC 2026 QR Drone Detector** is a high-performance, real-time computer vision system designed for drone-based QR code detection and tracking. Developed for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Innovation and Research Outreach Cell (IROUC) 2026 challenge, this system provides:

- **Ultra-fast QR detection** at 60+ FPS
- **Automatic orientation correction** with visual feedback
- **Seamless drone integration** with rotation commands
- **Long-range detection** using multi-scale processing
- **Auto-calibration** for different viewing angles

Whether you're tracking QR codes on moving drones, guiding autonomous landing sequences, or building a QR-based navigation system, this detector provides the reliability and performance you need.

## ✨ Features

### Core Capabilities
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🚀 **Real-time Detection** | 60+ FPS processing with threaded camera capture |
| 🎯 **Multi-Scale Detection** | 6 different scales for far/small QR codes |
| 🔄 **Auto-Calibration** | Learns reference orientation from 5 samples |
| 📐 **Orientation Analysis** | Calculates angle difference with 10° tolerance |
| 🎨 **Visual Overlay** | Colored bounding boxes with rotation arrows |
| 🔊 **Terminal Feedback** | Clear rotation instructions with angle data |
| 🚁 **Drone Control** | Sends ROTATE_LEFT/RIGHT commands automatically |
| 💻 **Webcam Support** | Works with laptop cameras and external USB webcams |

### Detection Strategies
The system uses 6 different image processing techniques to ensure maximum detection rate:

1. **Plain Grayscale** - Fastest detection for clear QR codes
2. **CLAHE Enhancement** - Improved contrast for poor lighting
3. **Sharpening Filter** - Enhances edges for blurry QR codes
4. **Otsu Thresholding** - Binary segmentation for high contrast
5. **Upscaling (1.8x)** - Better detection for small QR codes
6. **Downscaling (0.6x)** - Faster processing for large QR codes

### Visual Feedback System
- **Green Box** - QR matched with correct orientation ✓
- **Orange Box** - QR matched but needs rotation ⚠️
- **Red Box** - QR detected but wrong seed ❌
- **Grey Box** - Tracking predicted position (lost temporarily)
- **Rotation Arrow** - Animated arrow showing which direction to rotate

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV 4.5+
- NumPy
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)
- PyYAML (optional, for configuration)

## 🔧 Installation
Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Windows:

bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Linux/macOS:

bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies
bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
Step 4: Verify Installation
bash
python qr_drone_detector.py
You should see the camera selection prompt and the OpenCV window.

🚀 Quick Start
1. Run the Detector
bash
python qr_drone_detector.py
2. Select Camera
text
📷 Available camera indices:
   Index 0 - Built-in laptop camera
   Index 1 - External USB webcam

Select camera index (default 1 for external webcam): 
Press Enter for external webcam or type 0 for laptop camera.

3. Load Seed QR Image
A file dialog will open. Select an image containing the QR code you want to track.

4. Connect to Drone (Optional)
text
Connect to drone? (y/n): n
Select n if you don't have a drone (the system still works for visual feedback).

5. Start Scanning
Hold your QR code in front of the camera. The system will:

Detect the QR code

Compare with seed image

Show rotation instructions if needed

Send rotation commands to drone (if connected)

📖 Detailed Usage
Preparing Seed Images
For best results, prepare your seed image with these guidelines:

QR Code Quality

Use high-contrast QR codes (black on white)

Minimum size: 200x200 pixels

Ensure QR is not distorted

Reference Orientation

Hold QR upright when capturing seed image

System will calibrate to this orientation

QR can be rotated up to 45° in either direction

File Formats Supported

JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)

PNG (.png)

BMP (.bmp)

TIFF (.tiff)

python
# In WebcamStream.__init__
self.cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640)
self.cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 480)
Reduce Detection Strategies

python
# In QRWorker._run, comment out slower strategies
# scales = [1.0]  # Only use original scale
Increase Command Cooldown

python
# In DroneController.__init__
self.command_cooldown = 0.5  # seconds between commands
For Better Detection Range
Increase Multi-scale Options

python
scales = [2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.2, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6]
Improve Lighting

Add external light source

Avoid backlighting

Use matte QR codes (no glare)

Adjust Validation Parameters

python
# In is_valid_qr function
if mn < 10:  # Allow even smaller QR codes
🐛 Troubleshooting

Problem	Solution
Camera not detected	Try different index (0, 1, 2)
Black screen	Check camera permissions
Low FPS	Reduce resolution
Autofocus issues	Disable autofocus in code
Detection Issues
Problem	Solution
QR not detected	Improve lighting, move closer
False matches	Load clearer seed image
Slow detection	Reduce resolution or scales
Orientation wrong	Re-calibrate with R key

Commands delayed	Reduce command cooldown
Drone not responding	Check command format matches drone firmware
Common Error Messages
text
❌ Could not open camera 1

text
⚠️ No seed loaded
Solution: Select a valid QR image at startup or press L to load.
